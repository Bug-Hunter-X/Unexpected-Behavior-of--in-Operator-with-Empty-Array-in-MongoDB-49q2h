# Unexpected Behavior of $in Operator with Empty Array in MongoDB

This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug related to the use of the `$in` operator in MongoDB queries with an empty array.  The issue lies in the unexpected behavior when using `$in` with an empty array.  The query returns no results, unlike SQL where an empty IN clause often returns all rows.

## Bug Description
When querying a MongoDB collection using the `$in` operator with an empty array, the query returns an empty result set, even if the field specified exists in the documents.

## Reproduction Steps
1. Create a MongoDB collection with some sample data.
2. Execute a `find` query using the `$in` operator and an empty array to filter on a particular field.
3. Observe that the query returns no results, regardless of whether the field is present in the documents.

## Solution
To correctly handle cases where an empty array is passed as an argument to `$in`, additional logic should be added to handle these scenarios appropriately. One method is to use an alternative approach, such as a logical OR statement, when the array is empty, which ensures that the query does not return an empty result.
